# `Jamal::Linux::Toolbox`

Hello, this is the repository for my personal cli program. 
The goal of my script is to automate common task
on linux I use for programming. Such as install applications,
tools, or config file setup defaults.

So far this crate doesn't have any dependency's. This is not accident. I'm trying to grow my understanding of the code I write and I found
the best ways to do that is solve my problems myself.
